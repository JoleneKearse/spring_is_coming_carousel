# spring_is_coming_carousel

Based on the Photo Carousel project in Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path's Module 5: Essential JavaScript Concepts.

The photos were my own to show the coming of spring.

## The Minimum Viable Project

- Nice centered photo carousel
- Buttons place on top of images
- Ability to change images shown by clicking the next and previous buttons, including cycling through more than once

## My Additions

- Slide indicators
- Light / dark mode toggle
- Responsiveness
